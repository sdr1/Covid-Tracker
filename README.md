# Covid-Tracker
Tracking the spread of COVID 19 with data from the CDC and covidtracker.com

For best results, download the HTML and then load it in your favorite browser or download the RMD and run it in R.  All of the datafiles are linked to their websources using fread, so you don't need to download any additional CSVs.  

For worse results, click the "View raw" link or download the RMD and then convert the HTML to PDF without adding some nifty Latex sideways table documentation.
