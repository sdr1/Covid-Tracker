# Covid-Tracker
This repository tracks the spread of COVID 19 with data from the CDC and covidtracker.com.

I couldn't find a report in a format I liked, so I created this repository.  (On a side note, I probably wasted more time creating the repository than I would have if I just went to the myriad of COVID tracker sites I visited.)

To see this rendered you can go to <https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sdr1/Covid-Tracker/blob/master/Covid-Figures-and-Maps.html>. (The default file is too large for GitHub to display but HTML Preview will render it.)

For more labor intenstive results, download the HTML and then load it in your favorite browser or download the RMD and run it in R.  All of the data files are linked to their websources using *fread*, so you don't need to download any additional CSVs. 

For worse results, view the raw file on mobile or download the RMD and then convert the HTML to PDF without adding some nifty Latex sideways table documentation.

If you think I've made an error, email me.
